This repository contains projects I completed at the University of North Texas, Oregon State University, and the regular/advanced web development bootcamp offered on udemy.com.

This repository also contains a personal project that I have been working on that uses 2 temperature and humidity sensors with my raspberry pi so that I could experiment with Google chart tools, such as line charts and a gauge with a dial.

I am currently working on completing the advanced web development boot camp, where I'll gain knowledge on the following topics:
- CSS Animations
- CSS Flexbox
- Async Javascript Functions
- AJAX
- Jasmin Unit Testing
- Advanced Array Methods
- Closure and the Keyword 'this'
- OOP with JavaScript
- API calls with Node and Mongo
- ES2015
- D3 and the DOM
- React
- The Virtual DOM, Events, and Forms
- Redux
